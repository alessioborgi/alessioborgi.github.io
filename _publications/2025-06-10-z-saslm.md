excerpt: "**Z-SASLM** introduces a zero-shot, fine-tuning-free approach to **style alignment** in diffusion models by blending multiple reference styles directly in **latent space** using **spherical linear interpolation (SLI)** with learned, context-aware weights. The method avoids model retraining, preserves content semantics, and yields consistent style transfer across prompts and seeds."

We introduce Z-SASLM, a Zero-Shot Style-Aligned SLI (Spherical Linear Interpolation) Blending Latent Manipulation pipeline that overcomes the limitations of current multi-style blending methods. Conventional approaches rely on linear blending, assuming a flat latent space leading to suboptimal results when integrating multiple reference styles. In contrast, our framework leverages the non-linear geometry of the latent space by using SLI Blending to combine weighted style representations. By interpolating along the geodesic on the hypersphere, Z-SASLM preserves the intrinsic structure of the latent space, ensuring high-fidelity and coherent blending of diverse styles--all without the need for fine-tuning. We further propose a new metric, Weighted Multi-Style DINO VIT-B/8, designed to quantitatively evaluate the consistency of the blended styles. While our primary focus is on the theoretical and practical advantages of SLI Blending for style manipulation, we also demonstrate its effectiveness in a multi-modal content fusion setting through comprehensive experimental studies. Experimental results show that Z-SASLM achieves enhanced and robust style alignment.

**Highlights**
- **Zero-shot**: no fine-tuning or additional training stages.
- **Multi-style blending**: combine several style references with controllable influence.
- **Stable latent manipulation**: SLI-based mixing reduces artifacts and preserves structure.
- **Plug-and-play**: drop-in for common latent-diffusion pipelines.
