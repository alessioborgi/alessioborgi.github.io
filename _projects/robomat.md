# RoboMAT

### Copyright © 2024 Alessio Borgi

RoboMAT is a comprehensive MATLAB library designed to address a variety of robotics tasks. This library offers a suite of tools and functions for robotic simulations, control systems, kinematics, dynamics, and path planning. With RoboMAT, researchers and engineers can easily implement and test robotic algorithms in a MATLAB environment.

## Features
- **Robotic Simulations:** Create and simulate different robot models, including manipulators and mobile robots.
- **Kinematics:** Compute forward and inverse kinematics for various robotic configurations.
- **Dynamics:** Model and simulate the dynamics of robotic systems using standard algorithms like Newton-Euler.
- **Control Systems:** Implement classical and modern control algorithms to manage robotic motion.
- **Path Planning:** Integrate various path planning techniques to navigate robots in complex environments.
- **Sensor Integration:** Includes functions for integrating sensors like LiDAR and cameras for perception tasks.
- **Extensible:** Easily extend the library by adding custom robot models and algorithms.
