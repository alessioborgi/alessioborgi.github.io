### 🚀 I’m open to collaborate!
**I’m eager to work with anyone who has great ideas, wants to learn more and more and also share their experience to others.** Don’t hesitate to write me if you’d like to propose your help or ask for mine on a project, research, paper-idea, or a moonshot you’re cooking up.

## Hi, I’m Alessio 👋
I’m a PhD student in **Graph Neural Networks and Generative AI**, under the supervision of **Prof. Pietro Liò (University of Cambridge)** and **Prof. Fabrizio Silvestri (Sapienza University of Rome)**. I have obtained my **Master of Science** in **Artificial Intelligence & Robotics** and my **Bachelor of Science** in **Applied Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence** at **Sapienza University of Rome**, both with the highest marks. My research sits at the intersection of **Graph Neural Networks**, **Geometric Deep Learning**, and **Diffusion Models**, with applications to **Robotics**, **Vision**, and **Biomedical AI**. I have

I love turning rigorous theory into working systems—and then open-sourcing the whole thing so others can build on it.

- 🏆 **Best Poster Award**, M2L Summer School (2024)  
- 🧪 **CVPR 2025 Workshops** author: *Z-SASLM — Zero-Shot Style-Aligned SLI Blending for Latent Manipulation*  
- 🔬 Projects spanning **equivariant sheaf diffusion**, **graph generation**, **robotics control**, and **medical imaging**

---

## What I’m into (right now)
- **Equivariant Sheaf NNs** — fiber-aware transports, E(n)-equivariance, polynomial/sheaf diffusion  
- **Diffusion models** — multi-style conditioning, latent manipulation, stable zero-shot style alignment  
- **Graphs everywhere** — protein/structure generation, heterophily benchmarks, EEG/brain graphs  
- **Robotics** — kinematics/dynamics, planning, simulation-to-real pipelines

---

## Selected highlights
- **Z-SASLM (CVPR 2025 Workshops)** — zero-shot, fine-tuning-free **style alignment** via **SLI latent blending**  
- **CareConnect** — chat + graphs to orchestrate queries and robotic actions in clinical scenarios  
- **XGNN GraphGenRL** — policy-based, model-level explanations via **graph generation**  
- **RoboMAT** — a MATLAB library for core robotics tasks (kinematics, control, simulation)

## How I like to collaborate
- **Clear goals, fast iterations** — short sprints, public ablations, reproducible seeds.  
- **Transparent repos** — tidy READMEs, configs, and **W&B** (or similar) logs.  
- **Strong baselines** — fair comparisons, stats tests, and error analysis over cherry-picked plots.  
- **Write it as we build** — draft notes, figures, and bib entries early; keep LaTeX in sync with code.

If that resonates, let’s build something together →

## A few things I’m exploring next
- **Equivariant Sheaf Diffusion** for controllable **graph/protein generation**  
- **Brain-graph learning** at scale (EEG pipelines, sheaf-aware connectomes)  
- **Robotics + GenAI** bridges: safe planning, visual servoing, and world-model alignment

---

## Beyond research
I run educational content on **AI & Robotics**—explaining advanced ideas with approachable visuals and demos. If you’re into open science, teaching, or building tools for learners, I’d love to jam.
